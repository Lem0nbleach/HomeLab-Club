# HomeLab-Club
The HomeLab club is exactly like its name, all we do here in the club is HomeLab studies. So, before we go any deeper, we need to answer the question before everything: What is HomeLab?
## What is HomeLab?
HomeLab is the combination of two words, one is home and the other one is obviously, Lab. First we know this is something that we can do at home, which means the the scale of it is often not huge, unless you are dedicated into enlarging the scale of course. And the lab, the word lab we are talking about here is not the lab that you do chemistry or physics or just those labs that you are have scientist that wear white lab coats and mixing up this and that â€“ no, no, the lab we are talking about here is the computer lab, where servers are going woohm woohm!
