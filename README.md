# HomeLab-Club

The HomeLab club is exactly like its name, all we do here in the club is HomeLab studies.

So, before we go any deeper, we need to answer the question before everything: What is HomeLab?

## What is HomeLab?

HomeLab is the combination of two words, one is home and the other one is obviously, Lab. 

First we know this is something that we can do at home, which means the the scale of it is often not huge, unless you are dedicated into enlarging the scale of course. 

And the lab, the word lab we are talking about here is not the lab that you do chemistry or physics or just those labs that you are have scientist that wear white lab coats and mixing up this and that â€“ no, no, the lab we are talking about here is the computer lab, where servers are going woohm woohm!

## Why would I want to do HomeLab?

We already know that HomeLab equals home servers, why do we want to do our own servers? 

There is a simple answer for this question: because they are **BETTER**!

### Services only for you

Hosting your own servers, assuming that you know what a server does, you can host any service that you want to use, without paying any fees to those capitalistic companies trying to earn as much as possible from your wallet. 

Yes you will need to pay for the hardware and the electricity bills, also days to weeks to learn how to host them, but you those are investments for the long term you will no longer have to watch your bills go to hundreds per month.

It's about sustainability.

### Controllability

With self-hosted servers, you have full control over the server. This means you will get to change anything that you want your services have. 

From the software to use to the method of hosting, you will be able to control everything. 

Annoyed by Gmail uploading files to Drive because they are too big? Host your own email server! Annoyed by Adobe cloud limiting the file types that you can upload? Host your own cloud service! Annoyed by how the servers of your game keep going down and glitching? Host your own game servers! 

With self-hosting, you will get to control all the limits and function of your services, no longer need to suffer from being limited by the companies of the services that you are using.

### Future career

IT(Information Technology)/IS(Information Service) can be your future my guy/girl! With the knowledge that you will learn with us in this club, you will have the starting knowledges of being: Network Engineer, Network Manager, Server Administrator, System Engineer, and etc. 

Our club will be the best fit of all of you that either already have an interest in IT/IS careers or wanting to experience what it is like to work in these fields.
